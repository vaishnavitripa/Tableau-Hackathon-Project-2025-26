# Fashion Retail Churn & Predictive Analytics using Tableau

## Overview
This project is a Tableau-powered analytics solution designed to help fashion and luxury e-commerce brands reduce customer churn and improve product strategy by combining sales analytics, predictive insights, and modern business workflows.

The solution demonstrates how Tableau dashboards can be integrated into collaboration and CRM environments such as Slack and Salesforce to transform insights into real-time business actions.

## Problem Statement
Fashion and luxury e-commerce brands face two critical challenges:
1. Identifying customers at risk of churn before revenue is lost.
2. Understanding which product categories, styles, and trends will drive future growth.

Traditional dashboards provide insights but often fail to integrate directly into day-to-day decision-making workflows.
